AsoCMS is currently organized in files. Here you can find a little summary of the files.

Files:

== Projectfile (*.ini) ==
The Projectfile describes the names of the other files in the Windows-INI-Format.

Example:
{{{
[Options]
descfile = descfile.txt
stencil = index.html
menu = menu.txt
output = html\
}}}

You see, a Projectfile has one section named 'Options'. The names of the keys describes the function of the entry.

== Descfile ==
The Descfile is a CSV (comma-seperated values) file which describes all pages.

Example:
{{{
"Main Page","index","index.txt"
"About us","about-us","about-us.txt"
}}}
The Values:
"_Page title displayed in the browser_","_Name of the HTML-file (without extension)_","_Content-File_"
